# **Find the resort that's right for you!**

**Shredding the Gnar** was motivated by a desire to identify and locate the multitude of ski and snowboard resorts around the US, our teamâ€™s goal is to create a page to access information about each resort. Our target audience is people with all levels of ski/snowboard experience and a range of budgets. We seek to create a site that is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and informative to provide the user with a streamlined experience in finding their next ski/snowboard location.
